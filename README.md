# PHP-website-university-project
A website that I made as a project at my university. It uses PHP as a backend and MySQL to store data.

I used the phpmailer library to send authorization emails to people wanting to sign up. You can run the website using a local server. I used the wampserver application
 (https://www.wampserver.com/en/) during development which automatically installs apache, mysql, php and phpmyadmin.
